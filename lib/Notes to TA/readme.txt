1. Set the @describe_instruction boolean to True or False to print or not print the description printed in the console respectively.
2. I have added an additional instruction as "PS" to print state at any particular program counter. You can add remove it as per your wish.
3. I have once again used a temp variable to change contents od A and B in XCH Command. Could have used Swap method as well idk.
